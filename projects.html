                            Black Sheep Barkeep is a fullstack web app I made using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
                            The database consists of over 600 recipes and is still growing! In it's current state you can
                            search for recipes by name, ingredients, or category. The ingredients search enables users to
                            search for recipes with only the ingredients that they specified or they can search for
                            recipes that include at least one of the specified ingredients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I plan on adding support for user accounts and enabling users to save recipes to revisit later. The biggest feature of having an account would be having the ability to store your stock so you can always login to see the recipes you can make.

                        Pomodoro Timer

                        <p>
                            I made this Pomodoro Timer desktop application in Java using Java FX and Screenbuilder. It started out as an idea
                            for a simple weekend project I could do. At the time I created this app it was my first real personal project and was
                            very eye-opening. I found myself having to google many questions and read documentation. Although it is a very simple
                            idea, creating this app showed me what it was like to work on a real project and step out of my course material a little bit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I didn't think this was something I would use after making it, but now I use it whenever working on a very big project or
                            whenever I'm studying for a long time. The Pomodoro Technique really does help with knowledge retention, productivity, and
                            avoiding getting burned out when working on large tasks.
