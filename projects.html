                <p>
                    This project was a challenge to myself to complete within a weekend. I realized I needed to practice Java and just start coding more often! The title links to this project's repository on my GitHub where you can see more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This timer is meant to be used for productivity and follows the pomodoro technique. The general concept of the pomodoro technique is that with frequent short breaks you can be more productive and will retain more information. Traditionally each pomodoro, the working period, lasts 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break. Every fourth pomodoro you take a longer 30 minute break before continuing along the same pattern. I went ahead and made my timer take in user input for custom work and break durations, each fourth pomodoro simply adds these two values for the long break.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To create this project I used JavaFX 16, SceneBuilder, and both Java's TimerTask and Timer classes. One thing that I orginally did not realize when beginning this project was that Timer objects run on separate threads. This certainly was very confusing to me when I tested my code for the first time and the timer was decreasing way faster than it should have. My solution to this problem, after realizing the cause, was to have one timer task track the the working period and then start into the break period. I can admit that this is not the most optimal solution, but now I know what to expect in the future!

                <p>
                    This was the final project for my Software I course. We had to use JavaFX and Java and were allowed to use SceneBuilder to create the GUI. This was my first large project and was a very rewarding experience in many ways. The title links to this project's repository on GitHub where you can see more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The situation we were given was to create an inventory management system for a small manufacturing company that was using spreadsheets for inventory management. The system had to organize parts and products, along with their associated parts. Specific part or product information could be modifed, be deleted, and of course simply be viewed.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This project was <strong><em>the</em></strong> project that really solidified my understanding of Object Oriented Programming. Before this project the concepts of inheritance and abstract classes always confused me. Clarification came from seeing how In-House and Outsourced objects could be instatiated, but a plain old Part object could not be instatianted. This helped me realize that subclasses of abstract classes force typing within that super class. Ultimately, this project gave me a concrete foundation for Object Oriented Programming and its associated concepts.

                <p>
                    This project was made in Python using Selenium for my current job. In the car rim business there is one company, LKQ, that sets the rules. Due to this we use their part numbers for as much consistency as possible. The title links to this project's repository on GitHub where you can see more.
                    <br/>
                    <br />
                    Our inventory gets fed into eBay listings and into listings on our Website. The product details are usually taken off of LKQ's website manually and put into our database for accuracte product specifics, which is important for fitment. This project scrapes all needed rim information from LKQ's website and organizes it so I can send it to our IT team.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Although I have used Selenium in the past, I feel that this time I used it more efficiently. This combined with the Object Oriented Programming concepts I have been learning made this project a breeze. Each part number search creates a new rim object and as information is scraped from the website the rim object's attributes are set. Each valid rim object is added to an array which is then iterated through in order to write each rim and rim specifics to an output csv file.

                        This script was created due to my frustration of having a large excel window open in my already cluttered virtual workspace. Having to search through the excel sheet is as simple as pressing CTRL + F, but why do that when I can make it smaller and just type in my search? This title does not redirect to a GitHub repository as the Code Snippet box contains the entire program code!
                        <br/>
                        <br />
                        On our website and eBay account we list the inventory of a LKQ subsidiary, Coast to Coast, as available. This means that I often have to search through their inventory when fulfilling orders as well as ours.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The script simply uses python's csv module to read in the information stored in the inventory csv. The script searches for partial matches so that I can view all of the avalable color options. As the file's rows are iterated through, an output string is built with numbered results, part number, and quantity. The numbered results was something I originally did so that I could easily incorporate automatic drop ship emails being sent if I selected a search result's number. This idea turned out to be unnecessary as most searches do not result in an immediate drop ship being made.
