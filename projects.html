                    This project was made during in a weekend as a way to practice and brush up on Java a bit. It reminded me just how powerful and precise Java is as a language, something I didn't quite appreciate before.
                    <br/>
                    During this project I learned that the Timer class runs on a separate thread, managing multiple threads not being something I have done before. That certainly complicated a seemingly simple project, but overall was very fun to make!
