                                When I got Zeus in the summer of 2019 I found myself very interested in dog training and how we can, in a way, communicatate with dogs. Since then he has grown quite a bit, going from a 10 pound ball of craziness to an 85 pound cuddle bug.

                                I have always found that I love to spend time outside and in nature. I think a big reason I enjoy spending time in nature is the idea of just enjoying my surroundings and not being constantly distracted by technology. Please enjoy this image of me trying to get Zeus to appreciate the view.

                                I like both analog and digital photography. I own 3 analog cameras, because they are cheap, but also because I prefer film photography to digital. I do have a digital camera and use it more often, mostly because it is significantly more affordable per frame. This is a picture that I took on a family trip to Korea!

                                I have been playing soccer for as long as I can remember! I have played in many different positions, but left wing will always be my favorite. Soccer was definitely one of those things that made moving around significantly easier.

                                Most wouldn't consider this a difficult question to answer, but I certainly do. This question is difficult for me to answer due to the fact that my dad joined the Army when I was a baby. Our first move was to Germany, the country I have lived in the longest. Although we did move around a few times and I attended 2 elementary schools, we were always in the same general area. The reason we ended leaving Germany was because my dad did not extend his contract with the Army. During this time, my mom was working on securing a position as a teacher with the Department of Defense Education Activity. Her new position sent us to Okinawa, Japan even though that was our last choice of a dozen different places. We moved away from Okinawa due to a bad case of Island Fever. After all, you can drive around the entire island in just 2 hours. After that, schools and jobs just kept closing and the government kept on relocating us.

                                I was born in Miami, Florida. I don't remember it at all, but according to my parents we
                                could see the Sunlife Stadium from our house! We moved to Germany when I was about 2 years old.

                                every year on the street pictured to the right. Don't skip out on the hot apple cider!

                                right outside of the Air Force Base gate and was where I realized I love butter chicken curry.

                                Going into a high school with 2,500 students from a middle school with about 200 students was definitely
                                a shocker. Pictured is the <em>haunted</em> cotton gin downtown. Let's just say that I don't think it is haunted.

                                discovered I love while in Hiroshima for a soccer tournament. I can't wait for the day I get to go back to Japan.
