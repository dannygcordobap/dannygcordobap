                To be honest I am not entirely sure! Before made the drastic change from pursuing Chemical engineering,
                to pursuing Computer Science I always thought it would be cool to have my own website. Here you will find
                any information about me that you may be curious about as a potential candidate for your company, which I
                likely applied to. I just want to apologize now for adding to your potentially already large workload.
