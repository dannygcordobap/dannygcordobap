                            Welcome to my personal website! Here you can find my resume, my projects, and some general information about me.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            If you would be interested in checking out some of my projects then the projects section would be a great place to go! There I have code snippets along with project background and specifics to give you a better understanding of how each project works and which technologies were used! I also try to touch on what I learned from each project and how each one helped me grow as a programmer.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            My resume can be viewed in the resume section, where I also include my technical skills with familiarity ratings. As I gave myself these ratings I tried to be a bit more conservative. I am excited to grow and develop to the point where I feel comfortable saying my skill level in any technical area is advanced.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            If you would be interested in learning about me and my interests feel free to check out the about section. That is where I address the question and why it is so difficult for me to answer. I also cover some of my hobbies as well as why I want to pursue a career in software engineering. There may also be a picture of my dog.
