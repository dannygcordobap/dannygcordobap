### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**dannygcordobap/dannygcordobap** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a bar manager web app, aptly called Not a Bartender, that gives suggestions based on what you have and tracks your stock levels.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a third party python library Flask and sqllite3 in order to build Not a Bartender. I am also going to start learning Javascript to optimize my personal website (really just to add a sticky nav bar and some awesome collabsibles) as well as C++.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything! If you wanna collaborate on a probram that adds two numbers I am ready.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Not a Bartender. It is turning out to be much more involved than I expected and would love help, but I will most definitely figure it out if need be.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my dog! I can talk about him for hours on end so just make sure that you have the time.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dannygcordobap@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was younger I really hoped that I would get a letter from Hogwarts on my 11th birthday.
