### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**dannygcordobap/dannygcordobap** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a bar manager web app, aptly called Not a Bartender, that gives suggestions based on what you have.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my dog! I can talk about him for hours on end so just make sure that you have the time.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: dannygcordobap@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was younger I really hoped that I would get a letter from Hogwarts on my 11th birthday.
